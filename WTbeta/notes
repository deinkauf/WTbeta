// TODO -- 11/23

--Don--

settings button -> settingsView with sign out button
add dog function attached to plus on dog card
edit dog function attached to (-) on dog card

--Mas--
(X) --> create the DogPark() struct/class ?
start building DogParkVM
simplistic DogPark Card
have middle tab displaying list of dogparks pulled from db with live count of checkedIn Dogs
