NOTES:

** do we need to use codable?? **
** do we use structs or classes?? **j

// TODO -- 11/23

have right tab show user's name and dogs' details
create the DogPark() struct/class ?
add defaultDogPark variable to User class
have left tab show default dog park
have middle tab displaying list of dogparks pulled from db with live count of checkedIn Dogs
when "check in" function fires, simply iterates the checkedIn count, and other users see change in real time
attach actual Dog models to checkedIn dogs of dogParks (i see dog, click on dog, and am taken to dog details)
