# WTbeta
beta version of WagginTails App

--MAIN IDEA--

'no more showing up to an empty dogpark.'

-see dogparks in your area.

-(backend runs a 'dogpark' search through apple maps api to add dogparks to DB if not already stored.)

  -i.e. self-sufficient growth with userbase.
  
-see who's checked in to dogparks in your area.

-each user's dog assigned an id card with bio/general info

--TO RUN--
1) download zip or clone repo ('main' branch is working beta)
2) open and run on xcode simulator

--built with firebase // swiftui

--built by donovan einkauf and mason hendry
